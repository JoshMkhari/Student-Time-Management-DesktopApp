# Personal Time Planner

This repository contains the code for a personal time planner application developed in C# using the .NET framework. The application allows users to manage their time effectively by specifying a semester duration, adding modules with associated credits and hours, and planning their study schedule.

## Key Features

- User authentication and registration
- Semester duration specification
- Module management (add, view, delete)
- Study planning and scheduling
- Calendar view with planned study hours and remaining self-study hours

## Code Overview

The provided code files demonstrate various programming skills and concepts, including:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - The code follows an object-oriented approach, utilizing classes to encapsulate related data and functionality.
   - Classes such as `UserModel`, `CalendarModel`, and `ModuleAdderModel` promote code organization and reusability.

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - The application interacts with a database using the `ProgramDAL` class, which handles data access and persistence.
   - It demonstrates skills in storing and retrieving data from a database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

3. **Data Manipulation**:
   - The code performs various data manipulation tasks, such as adding, updating, and retrieving data from lists and databases.
   - It showcases proficiency in working with collections, executing CRUD operations, and handling data dependencies.

4. **User Authentication and Security**:
   - The `UserModel` class implements user login and signup functionality, including password encryption using MD5 hashing.
   - It demonstrates an understanding of user authentication and security practices.

5. **Date and Time Handling**:
   - The code extensively works with dates and times using the `DateTime` class.
   - It performs date calculations, comparisons, and formatting, showcasing skills in handling dates and times effectively.

6. **Event Handling and Data Binding**:
   - The code handles user interactions through event handlers and likely utilizes data binding techniques to connect UI elements with underlying data models.
   - It demonstrates an understanding of event-driven programming and data binding concepts.

7. **Error Handling and User Feedback**:
   - The code includes error handling mechanisms, such as displaying error messages, to provide user feedback and handle exceptional situations gracefully.
   - It showcases the ability to handle errors and communicate effectively with users.

8. **String Manipulation and LINQ**:
   - The code performs various string manipulation tasks and utilizes LINQ for database queries and data manipulation operations.
   - It demonstrates proficiency in working with strings and applying LINQ for efficient data retrieval and transformation.

9. **Modularity and Code Organization**:
   - The code is organized into separate classes and methods, each responsible for specific functionality.
   - It promotes modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.

10. **Data Validation and Integrity**:
    - The code includes data validation checks to ensure data integrity and validate user input.
    - It demonstrates an understanding of the importance of data validation in maintaining a reliable and consistent application.

## Conclusion

The personal time planner application showcases a wide range of programming skills and concepts, including object-oriented programming, data persistence, data manipulation, user authentication, date and time handling, event handling, error handling, string manipulation, LINQ, modularity, and data validation. These skills are essential for developing robust, maintainable, and user-friendly applications in C# and the .NET framework.

The code provided serves as a solid foundation for further enhancements and features to be added to the personal time planner application.
